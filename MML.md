### Basic command

#### A-G [&lt;accidental&gt;] [&lt;length&gt;] [&lt;dot&gt;]

Outputs the sound of the specified note name.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;accidental&gt;|Specify the accidental symbols with "#", "+", and "-". "#" and "+" correspond to semitone up, and "-" correspond to semitone down.|
|&lt;length&gt;|Specify the length of the sound in the range from 0 to 64. 1 represents a whole note, 4 represents a quarter note. If you omit &lt;length&gt;, the note length will be the value specified by the L command. It is also possible to specify 0 as the length of the note. In this case, no sound is generated. This value is primarily used for the final tone of a slur (&) string.|
|&lt;dot&gt;|Specify the dot with ".". If you write one dot, the length of the sound will be 1.5 times (=1+0.5). If you write two, the length of the sound will be 1.75 times (= 1 + 0.5 + 0.25). Up to 3 dots can be described.|

**Example:**
```
C#2.
```

#### N &lt;note-number&gt; [&lt;dot&gt;]

Specify the note number and output the sound. The note length follows the value specified with the L command.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;note-number&gt;|Specify the note number value in the range from 0 to 95. For example, N36 corresponds to O4C and N52 corresponds to O5E. However, N0 is treated as a rest, not O1C.|
|&lt;dot&gt;|Specifies a dot. The dot effect is the same as for A-G.|

**Example:**
```
L4O4CEG.R8 N36N40N43.R8
```

#### R [&lt;length&gt;] [&lt;dot&gt;]

Insert a rest.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;length&gt;|Specify the length of the rest in the range of 1 to 64. 1 represents a whole rest, 4 represents a quarter note rest. If this value is omitted, the rest length is determined by the value of the parameter "mode" of the method SetMML/SetSeMML() as follows:<br> - If the 0th bit of mode is 0, the rest length is 4 (quarter rest).<br> - If the 0th bit of mode is 1, the length of the rest will be the value specified by the L command.|
|&lt;dot&gt;|Specifies a dot. The dot effect is the same as for A-G.|

**Example:**
```
L4
CR8 C16R16 CR
CR8 C16R16 CR
```

Outputs a noise sound with the frequency set by the I command.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;length&gt;|Specifies the length of the noise in the range 1 to 64. If this value is omitted, the length of the noise is determined by the value of the parameter "mode" of the method SetMML/SetSeMML(), just like the R command.|

A2R2 A4&A4R2 A2&>A0R2 A2&<A0R2
```

#### _[_ [&lt;loop-number&gt;] ... [|] ... _]_

Loop playback of MML in []. Loops can be nested up to 3 levels. Loop symbols after the 4th level are ignored.
A "|" symbol may also be inserted in the loop section. This symbol serves as a break statement for the inserted loop section.
However, this symbol functions as a break statement only for the last loop.

**NOTE:**
The primary loop of the MML registered with the SetMML() method can only be terminated using the FinishPrimaryLoop() method. When this method is called, if there are two or more remaining loop iterations, including the current one being executed, the number of remaining loop iterations is reduced to two. This method is primarily intended to be used when exiting infinite loops in BGM.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;loop-number&gt;|Specify the loop count in the range from 0 to 255. However, if 0 is specified, it will be an infinite loop. If this value is omitted, the loop count will be 1.|

**Example1:**
```
O3[3 C&>C0]

```
**Example2:**
```
[4 CD|ER4] CR4

```

## Software envelope generator

In addition to PSG's built-in envelope generator, Psgino also supports volume control using software envelopes.
This feature can only be enabled if the volume is controlled with the V command rather than the S command.
The shape of the envelope is set with 5 parameters (AHDSFR method without "R").
This envelope volume control can be set independently for each channel.

#### $E &lt;enabled&gt;

Sets ON/OFF of volume control by software envelope. This value defaults to OFF.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;enabled&gt;|Set in the range from 0 to 1. 0 corresponds to OFF and 1 to ON.|

**Example:**
```
V15L4O4
$A0$H100$D100$S90$F2000

$E0
CDE2

$E1
CDE2
```

#### $A &lt;attack&gt;

Specifies the rise time of the sound (the arrival time from 0 to the volume set by the V command).

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;attack&gt;|Specify in the range from 0 to 10000. The unit is ms. If 0 is specified, sound rise processing is not performed, and sound is output at the volume set with the V command.|

#### $H &lt;hold&gt;

Sets the retention time of the volume level after attack.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;hold&gt;|Specify in the range from 0 to 10000. The unit is ms. If 0 is specified, Decay processing will start immediately.|

#### $D &lt;decay&gt;

Sets the time it takes for the volume to reach the Sustain value after Hold.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;decay&gt;|Specify in the range from 0 to 10000. The unit is ms. If 0 is specified, the volume is immediately set to the Sustain value and fade processing is started.|

#### $S &lt;sustain&gt;

Sets the target volume level for Decay processing.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;sustain&gt;|Specify in the range from 0 to 100. The unit is %. Corresponds to the percentage of the volume specified by the V command.|

#### $F &lt;fade&gt;

Specifies the time from the Sustain value to 0 after the Decay process is complete.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;fade&gt;|Specify in the range from 0 to 10000. The unit is ms. However, if 0 is specified, the volume will keep the Sustain value.|

## Software LFO

Psgino has a software LFO. By enabling this function, you can output a sound with vibrato.

#### $M &lt;mode&gt;

Sets ON/OFF for the software LFO. This value defaults to OFF.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;mode&gt;|Sets the software LFO mode from 0 to 1. 0 corresponds to OFF and 1 to ON (modulated by triangular wave).|

**Example:**
```
V15L4O4
$J4$L80$T8

$M0
CDE2

$M1
CDE2
```

#### $J &lt;depth&gt;

Sets the modulation depth. Modulation depth defaults to 0.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;depth&gt;|Specifies the modulation depth in the range 0 to 255. If the modulation depth is n, the frequency of the sound varies from 2^(-n/360) times to 2^(n/360) times depending on the modulation function.|

#### $L &lt;low-frequency&gt;

Sets the modulation frequency. The default modulation frequency is 40 ( = 4.0 Hz).

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;low-frequency&gt;|Specifies the modulation frequency in the range 0 to 200. The unit is 0.1 Hz.|

#### $T &lt;delay&gt; [&lt;dot&gt;]

Specifies the time from the start of sound output until the LFO operates. This value defaults to 0.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;delay&gt;|Specifies the delay time of the LFO in the range from 0 to 128. If delay is non-zero, it uses the same calculations as the L command to determine the delay time. For example, if the delay is set to 4, the LFO operation will start after the time of one quarter note has passed after the start of sounding. If delay is 0, the delay time will be 0.|
|&lt;dot&gt;|Specifies a dot. The dot effect is the same as for A-G.|


### Other commands

#### $B &lt;bias&gt;

Bias the frequency of the output sound. The default value for bias is 0.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;bias&gt;|Specify the bias in the range (-500) to 500. If the bias value is n, the frequency of the output sound will be the value multiplied by 2^(n/360).|


**Example1:**
```
V15L4O4
CDE2
$B30 CDE2
$B60 CDE2
$B360 CDE2
```

**Example2:**
```
V15L1O4
AA
,
V15L1O4
A$B1A
```

#### $P &lt;pitchbend-level&gt;

Smoothly increases or decreases the frequency of the output sound to the value specified by pitchbend-level until the output stops. This value defaults to 0.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;pitchbend-level&gt;|Specifies the pitch bend level in the range from (-2880) to 2880. If the specified value is n, the frequency of the output sound changes smoothly up to the final value multiplied by 2^(n/360).|

**Example:**
```
V15L16O4
$P-360 CDEFGAB>C<
$P360 CDEFGAB>C<
```

#### @C &lt;data&gt;

Invoke the user-defined callback function. When decoding this command, synchronously invoke the registered callback function.
The interface for the callback function is as follows:

```
void (*user_callback)(uint8_t ch, int32_t param);
```
Here, ch represents the channel number of the MML where this command is written, and param represents the parameter of this command.

The function registered with SetUserCallback() is executed for MML registered with SetMML(), and for MML registered with SetSeMML(), the function registered with SetSeUserCallback() is executed.

|Values|Description|
|--|--|
|&lt;data&gt;|Specify the value to be stored in the parameter of the callback function as int32_t type.|

**Example:**
```
T120L4O4CE@C1234G,
T120L4O4EGB@C-999,
T120L4O4@C0GB>D
```

## Header section

To add a header to the beginning of the MML, you can do the following:

:V &lt;version-number&gt; [ [_header-command_] ... ];

The header starts with a colon and ends with a semicolon. If the header section is omitted, the MML is treated as version 1.

**NOTE:** Currently, there is only one version of MML, which is version 1.

### Header command

#### M &lt;mode-flags&gt;

This command sets the mode-flags for the MML. Each field of the flags is as follows:

|bit|Field|Description|
|--|--|--|
|15-1|-|Reserved.|
|0|RH_LEN|Switches the default value when the R,H command omits the note length specification. <br> - 0: The default value for note length is 4. <br> - 1: The default note length is the value specified with the L command.|

If this command is not executed, the mode flags will be set to the value specified by the argument mode.

**Example:**
```
:V1M1;
L4O4CEG.R8 N36N40N43.R8
```
